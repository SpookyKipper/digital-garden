# Opportunity Cost
## Highest Valued Option Forgone

### Explicit Cost
- out-of-pocket cost
- payment in taking the action
- e.g. money, trade items
### Implicit Cost
- opportunity cost
- not an **actual** payment
- e.g. time cost
	- Highest Valued Alternative Use of Time
### **Sunk** / Historical Cost
- Wasted time should not be considered

# Demand & Supply
### Individual Demand
- shows the amount of a good a buyer is **willing** and **able** to buy at all given prices over a period of time, **ceteris paribus**.
### Law of Demand
- When the price of a good **rises**/**drops**, the quantity demanded **drops**/**rises**, ceteris paribus.
- Price and Quantity Demanded are **negatively** related. According to the la of demand, the demand curve should be **downward** sloping.
### Equilibrium
**Quantity Demanded** = **Quantity Supplied**
## <u>Change in Demand & Supply</u>

Price of MTR increases, Demand for bus services increase
### Price of complement
**Joint Demand**
Price of cars decreases, Demand for Gasoline increases
### Income increases
Demand for Superior Goods increase
Demand for inferior/normal goods decrease

# Specialization / Division of labour
**In production, people are usually responsible for 1 task / good only**
### Simple Division of Labour
- A worker specialises in producing a particular type of goods or providing a particular type of services
- Different people produce different goods/services
- e.g. **doctor, engineer, domestic helper**: all not related
### Complex Division on Labour
- A worker specialises in one stage of a production process
- A production is divided into **different stages** of production of the **same good**
### Regional Division of Labour
- A country or a region specialises in producing a particular type of goods or providing a particular type of services
- Different countries / regions produce different goods / services

### Why division of labour?
- Raise labour productivity
	More output can be produced with the same amount of labour
- **Raise labour productivity**
- Practice makes perfect
- Save time in training and job rotation
- Manager can choose the **most suitable** person for the job
- <s>Workers to what they can do best</s>
- **Save resources** from producing capital tools

### Disadvantages of specialization
##### Workers: bored
1. Repeat the job every day
2. Feel bored
3. Lose working interest
4. Productivity drops
##### Production stages are interdependent 
- One stops, whole production process will be affected
##### Workers face higher risk of unemployment
 - Workers learn 1 skill only
 - Difficult for them to change jobs
##### Consumer have fewer choices
 - Machines are usually used
 - Products are standardized

### Limitations of Specialization
- Difficult / unnecessary to practice specialization if 
	1. **the firm is too small** 
		Too few workers
	2. **the market is too small**
		Small output is enough to satisfy the market demand

### Fixed Costs
- Costs do not change with output level
- E.g. rent
### Variable Costs
- Costs change with output level
- e.g. Gas, Electricity, Water
